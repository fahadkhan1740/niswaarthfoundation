About 15 million persons are expected to join the workforce every year. This talent pool needs to be adequately skilled. The Indian economy is poised for a major take off. The World Bank estimates that Indian GDP would be one of the best in the world by 2017. To achieve the same, skilled manpower is one of the most critical requirements. In order to meet this challenge, there is need for a major thrust to imbibe Indian youth with adequate skill expertise.</p>

                                <p align="justify"><span class="lead">Up-Skilling – The potential to impart modern and comprehensive skills required to meet the growing demand is highly inadequate in our country. It is reported that hardly 10% of the candidates entering the job market fully meet the criteria of the employment as desired by the employer. It is the gravity of this situation, that enhancement and upgrading of skills of the existing work force is hugely required.</p>
